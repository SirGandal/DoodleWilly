# DoodleWilly
Doodle Willy is a game for mobile devices inspired by the legend of William Tell.  William was an expert shot with the crossbow but on 18 November 1307 Tell and his young son visited Altdorf and passed by the hat, publicly refusing to bow to it, and so was arrested. Tell and his son would be executed, but he could redeem his life by shooting an apple off the head of his son, Walter, in a single attempt.  Let's help Willy not to fail in this challenge! Brake all the arrows that would hit his son and let pass the ones that go toward the apple in order to get more points, let the green ones to hit Walter and gain 1 life, break golden arrows to activate the power up of invincibility and try to protect Walter as long as you can!
